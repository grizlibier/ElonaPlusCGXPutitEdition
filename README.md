# Elona+ CGX: Putit Edition

# planned

Learning, Constitution and Willpower, evasion, some resistances buffs, also gives an unique trait called "spongy" which raises your Defence(scales to favor) upon praying. 

Acceptable offers: corpses, cloaks, girdles, cargoes of rag doll, cargoes of noble toy

First reward: rod of exploding putit(fires a putit-size fire projectile which explodes on impact. Has 10 uses but regenerates over time(this one is unsure cuz I have no idea how I'd so it, I don't think it's even possible. Will make it a 15 use wand with some good firepower). Each explosion has 1 tile radius, making the total amount of hit tiles a 9)

Second reward: cloak of Putit(makes all putits your allies which will assist you in combat, will spawn 2 putit tanks somewhere around you when critically hit)

Last reward: putit caster(a putit wizard companion who can spawn new putits and has access to the exploding putit spell. Weak melee)

Lore: Used to be a common putit at a putit farm and was sold to a traveller. The traveller did some weird experiments on the Putit, one of which was separating its soul from its body. The experiment was half-successful, the soul detached from the body but couldn't get back in. The spirit of the Putit wandered North Tyris for a very long time, across different timelines and just ended up wandering to the gods pantheon. Once there, the Putit was able to contact its bretheren and even got some humanoid believers for its empathy with the weak.(details are WIP)
